# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to the Specify CLI and templates are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `specify init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/speckit.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kit-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `speckit.` (e.g., `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
	- Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- `--force` flag for `init` command to bypass confirmation when using `--here` in a non-empty directory and proceed with merging/overwriting files.

## [0.0.15] - 2025-09-21

### Added

- Support for Roo Code.

## [0.0.14] - 2025-09-21

- Support for Auggie CLI. Thank you [@hungthai1401](https://github.com/hungthai1401) with [#137](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/pull/137).
- Agent folder security notice displayed after project provisioning completion, warning users that some agents may store credentials or auth tokens in their agent folders and recommending adding relevant folders to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

### Changed

- Warning displayed to ensure that folks are aware that they might need to add their agent folder to `.gitignore`.
- Cleaned up the `check` command output.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-09-21
